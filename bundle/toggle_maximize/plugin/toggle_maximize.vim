" ToggleMaximize v1.4.2 by joey.neuralyte.org
"
" Vim can support complex window layouts, but they can put users off because
" they reduce the size of the main editing window.  ToggleMaximize addresses
" this issue, by allowing the user to switch between a large editor window,
" and his own complex window layout.
"
" Press Ctrl-F or Ctrl-\ to maximize the size of the current window, press
" again to restore the original window layout.
"
" Ctrl-V and Ctrl-H toggle maximize in vertical/horizontal direction only.
"
" Maximization is forced to respect winminwidth and winminheight, so if you
" have these set, other windows will not fully shrink to the edges.
"
" If the user changes the size of any windows after maximizing, the script
" still thinks the toggle is ON, so next time it is used it will restore your
" old layout, rather than re-maximize (unlike some window managers).



" WARNING BUG TODO: If we create a new window while maximized (e.g. split the
" current window), restoring with winrestcmd completely fails!  I tend to
" notice this because in my usual layout the current window becomes very tiny!
"
" WORKAROUND: *DO NOT* create or split windows while maximized!  Just
" un-maximize to do that operation, until we fix this.  In emergencies: <C-W>=
"
" SOLUTION: We should continue to use the winrestcmd style of restoring sizes
" without visiting windows, but we must track old window sizes better than it
" does, e.g.  by buffer name, not by volatile window numbers.  I think one of
" our older revisions implemented a global dictionary of sizes, although
" perhaps indexed window number, not bufname.  The result of this would be
" that newly created windows would be squished on restoration.
"
" ALTERNATIVE: We could try to workaround this problem by restoring normal
" layout before any new windows are created, and re-maximizing afterwards.

" NOTE: There are a couple of other things that occasionally go wrong, namely:
" winrestcmd is still set but windows look restored.  winrestcmd is ignored.
" winheight=9999 before and after toggle!  These may only occur when
" re-sourcing the script during development (hopefully!).
"
" OK the problem here seems to be when I only toggle vertically, it doesn't
" clear the winrestcmd.  I've just forgotten I'm horizontally toggled too?
" Well if I don't have any horizontal splits then no I don't notice!

" SUCKS: Resizing Vim in your window manager does not cause winheight to be
"        re-enforced (until you change window).
" Hehe actually I tend to survive this because I have put MBE on cursorhold,
" so the winheight=9999 gets reinforced often.



" CONSIDER: An entirely alternative approach would be for "maximization" to
" simply open a new tab with the current buffer, and for "restoration" to
" close it and return to the previous tab.  This would even hide the
" StatusLines of other windows which we currently still display.



" CHANGELOG:
"
" 2011/12/15  Version 1.4 uses winrestcmd() and is a bit faster.  (Old methods
" of restoration via WinDo() tended to fight with winwidth/height settings,
" and also trigger WinEnter events in other plugins, e.g. MBE/Taglist.)



" NOTES ON OLD APPROACHES:
" Old versions used to visit the windows to resize them.  Large values of
" winwidth/height could cause problems restoring layout.  It was left to the
" user to set winwidth/height low or live with the bug!

" SUCKS: After all that refactoring, I note that windowid-indexed values apply
" to different windows when windows are closed or created, whereas
" window-local variables clean themselves up more tidily.  But window-local
" variables can only be accessed by visiting the window.
